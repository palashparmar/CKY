CKY is a parsing algorithm for context free grammers (Chomsky Normal Form) which uses probability to find the most probable parse and allow to recover the most probable parse given the probabilities of all productions.

## Running program
For execuating the program, run
```
python CKY.py <sentence file> <grammer rule file>
```
